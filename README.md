# xwhiff
expected Whiff project from DSCI 311 final project

The goal of this project was to explore a dataset, create a model, and then use the model to make an inference about the model and its prediction

The explore notebook cleans the datasets to be then used in the predict notebook, which predicts on Trackman data for the year 2024, which I use in the inference notebook

necessary packages: pandas, numpy, xgboost, optuna, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib

data is private Trackman data from the years 2022 to 2024
